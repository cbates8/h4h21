    <!-- <p id = "summary"> <br/> As non-black people of color, we are speaking from a unique position of privilege. The ability to absolve oneself from feeling and being complicit in anti-black violence by asserting “I am not white” is certainly not a solution here. However, while the murder of Floyd occurred in Minneapolis, the racism intrinsic to the police system infiltrates even precincts in your district. Acts of police violence and brutality committed on innocent, unarmed black people are all too common and we need your support to help create a safer community one district at a time.
